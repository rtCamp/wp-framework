 * hosting provider's own dev-env CLI, or any other container-based stack.
 * Each concrete adapter brings its own detection and answers the handful of
 * questions tooling actually asks: where the debug log is, which services are
 * up, whether the filesystem takes writes.
 *
 * Unlike most abstracts here this one is deliberately not `Registrable`: it
 * registers no WordPress hook. It is constructed and queried on demand by
 * whatever consumes it.
